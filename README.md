Module One : Software Engineering Essentials 
Assignment One 

Part 1

//Question one – Defining software engineering and its importance in the tech industry// 
Software engineering refers to the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications. It has to do with programming computer technology to build apps, websites, games and tools that simplify our lives. Software engineering is important to the technology industry as it is the backbone of the industry. It enhances innovation, improves education/skills development and it contributes significantly to a country’s economic growth.

//Question two -  Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering//
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)
-	This is where the term software engineering was formally introduced 
-	Software development was recognized as a formal engineering discipline and the need for systematic approaches, disciplined processes, and better project management was emphasized. 
Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
-	There was a rise in OOP with languages such as C++ and Java 
-	OOP revolutionized software design by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It allowed developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code, making large-scale software development more efficient and reducing complexity.

Agile Manifesto and Agile Methodologies (2001)
-	Publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 by 17 software developers.
-	This shifted the focus from rigid, document-heavy processes (like Waterfall) to flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote continuous delivery, adaptability to changing requirements, and team collaboration, transforming modern software engineering practices.

//Question three - Waterfall vs Agile technologies//
	
•	Waterfall methodologies are best for well-defined projects with fixed requirements and minimal changes expected. For example, government systems, infrastructure projects.
•	Agile methodologies are ideal for dynamic projects with evolving requirements and a need for frequent feedback. For example: Web and mobile apps.

// Question four - Roles and responsibilities of a software developer, a quality assurance engineer and a project manager within a software engineering team//

Software developer 
•	Role: The developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. 
•	Responsibilities: sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members including the designer and QA engineer 
Quality assurance engineer 
•	Role: create tests that identify if there are any issues with the software before it is deployed. 
•	Responsibilities: stakeholder collaboration, creating development standards and procedures for software developers, analyzing the product for bugs and improvement, 


Project manager 
•	Role: project planning, task management, communication, risk and issue management, tracking and reporting, budget and resource management, quality assurance and delivery. 
•	Responsibilities: technical understanding, team management, problem solving.  

//Question five - The importance of IDEs and VCs in the software development process//
IDEs streamline the software development process by offering a cohesive environment for writing, testing, debugging, and managing code, which improves productivity, reduces errors, and enhances code quality.
Version Control Systems are crucial for enabling collaboration, maintaining project history, preventing data loss, and improving overall software quality, especially in large, dynamic development teams.

//Question six – challenges faced by software engineers and strategies to overcome these challenges//
Challenge: Requirements may evolve during the development process due to changes in business needs, market conditions, or stakeholder input.
Strategies to overcome this challenge: adopting agile methodologies, maintaining frequent communication with stakeholders, and maintaining a flexible codebase
Challenge: Tight deadlines and time management 
Strategies to overcome these challenges: Prioritizing tasks, practicing time management and breaking down tasks into smaller manageable pieces. 
Challenge: Debugging and resolving complex bugs 
Strategies to overcome these challenges: peer collaboration, using debugging tools and rubber duck debugging 

//Question seven – different types of testing and their importance in software quality assurance//
Unit Testing – Essential in delivering high-quality, secure, and reliable software. It enhances user satisfaction, reduces costs, and helps maintain long-term software stability and performance.
Integration testing –  is essential for validating the interaction between software modules, ensuring system stability, and reducing integration-related bugs, leading to a more reliable and high-quality product.
Systems Testing – plays a crucial role in ensuring the software’s overall quality, stability, and reliability. It reduces the risk of post-release issues, enhances user satisfaction, and ensures a successful product launch.
Acceptance Testing –  In summary, acceptance testing is essential for verifying that the software meets business needs, improves user satisfaction, and minimizes post-release issues. It provides a final layer of assurance, ensuring the software is ready for deployment and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

PART 2 
//Question One – Prompt engineering and its importance in interacting with AI models// 
Prompt engineering is writing commands and questions to artificial intelligence to get a response. It is essentially a way to communicate with AI models and it is very important because it allows the AI to gather more data which improves it efficiency. Prompt engineering also enhances the accuracy of the responses generated by AI as well as its performance. 

//Question two – example of a prompt// 
Vague prompt example : provide me with information about South Africa 
-	This prompt is too vague, it is not clear, specific and concise – it has no details about what exactly I want to know about South Africa. The AI model ends up generating too much information which might not be what I am  looking for 

Improved prompt: Provide me with information on tourist attractions in South Africa, include information such as: places to sightsee, local food to try, places to go, hotels and accommodation. 
-	This prompt allows the AI model to provide information that is specific to exactly what I am looking for, it also allows for any further questions I may have about touring South Africa  to be tailored  to this prompt specifically, enhancing its efficiency.
